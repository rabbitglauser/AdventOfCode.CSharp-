# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository!

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers from around the world tackle 25 unique coding challenges throughout December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, focusing on problem-solving, algorithms, and creative coding. This repository features my solutions to each of the challenges, all implemented in **C#**.

Every year, I look forward to tackling these puzzles and improving my skills, and I’m excited to share my solutions with you! This repository will be updated daily with new solutions, and you can follow along as I code my way through December.

## 🔧 Features:
- Daily solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles (from Day 1 to Day 25).
- Implemented in **C#**, demonstrating practical problem-solving techniques.
- Clean, well-documented code with a focus on readability and efficiency.
- Solutions to challenges with explanations and insights.
- Code optimized for performance and scalability when possible.

## 🌟 How to Clone and Run the Project:
To get started with the Advent of Code solutions in C#, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


git clone https://github.com/rabbitglauser/AdventOfCode.CSharp-.git

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:


cd AdventOfCode.CSharp-
3. Open in an IDE
Open the project in your favorite C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider). Ensure that the IDE has support for C# and .NET.

4. Build and Run the Code
Depending on your IDE, you can build and run the project directly. Alternatively, if you're using the .NET CLI, you can run the following commands:

Build the project:
bash
Copy code
dotnet build
Run the code (replace DayX with the day you want to test):
bash
Copy code
dotnet run -- DayX
Each solution is organized by day, so you can easily navigate and execute individual days' puzzles.

5. Contribute or Customize
Feel free to fork this repository and add your own solutions or improvements! I welcome pull requests, suggestions, and feedback.

## 🚀 Why C#?
I chose C# for this challenge because it’s a powerful, flexible, and fun language to work with. It’s great for both beginners and experienced developers, and its rich set of libraries and features make it a joy to code in. Plus, I enjoy using the .NET ecosystem for solving algorithmic problems!

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- **C#** (latest version)
- **.NET Core** (cross-platform development)
- **LINQ** (for powerful querying and manipulation of data)
- **Unit Testing** (where applicable, to test the solutions)
