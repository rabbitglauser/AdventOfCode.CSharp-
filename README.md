Welcome to AdventCodeSolutions, my repository for the annual Advent of Code challenges! 🎅

This project is implemented in C# and contains my solutions for each day's puzzles. The goal of this repository is to solve and share creative solutions for the challenges, while also improving my C# programming skills.

📂 Repository Structure
Each day's solution is organized into a separate folder and file with the following structure:

Copy code
AdventCodeSolutions/
├── Day01/
│   └── Day1_HistorianHysteria.cs
├── Day02/
│   └── Day2_RedNosedReports.cs
├── Day03/
│   └── Day3_MullItOver.cs
└── README.md
File Naming Convention
Each solution file is named following the format: Day[XX]_[SolutionName].cs
This format helps identify the day and theme of the challenge.

🛠️ Prerequisites
To run the solutions:

Install .NET SDK.
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rabbitglauser/AdventOfCode.CSharp-.git
